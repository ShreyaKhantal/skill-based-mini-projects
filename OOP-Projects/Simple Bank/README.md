### Example of Operations

- **Create a Savings Account**:

  - Account Number: 123456
  - Initial Balance: 1000 Rs
  - Interest Rate: 4.5%
  
- **Deposit 500 Rs into the account**:
  - The new balance will be displayed after the deposit.
  
- **Withdraw 200 Rs from the account**:
  - If the balance is sufficient, the withdrawal will be successful and the new balance will be displayed.
  
- **Apply Interest**:
  - If the account is a savings account, applying the interest will increase the balance based on the specified rate.

## Known Issues

- Ensure that account numbers are unique.
- Maximum number of accounts is fixed at 100. The system will not allow more accounts to be created beyond this limit.
