# Library Management System

## Overview
The **Library Management System** is a C++ program that simulates a library's book and member management system. The program allows the addition of books and members (students or faculty), as well as borrowing and returning books. The system also provides the ability to display available books, list members, and track issued books. It ensures that each member can borrow books according to their limits (students can borrow up to 5 books, while faculty can borrow unlimited books).

The system uses a combination of **Book** and **Member** classes, with **Student** and **Faculty** as derived classes. The books are stored in a collection, and each member can have a list of borrowed books. The system also checks for book availability before issuing and ensures that the number of borrowed books does not exceed the limit.

## Features
- **Add Books**: Add books to the library with a specified title, author, and number of copies.
- **Add Members**: Add members to the library, including students (who can borrow up to 5 books) and faculty (who can borrow unlimited books).
- **Issue Books**: Allow members to borrow available books, with checks for book availability and borrowing limits.
- **Return Books**: Allow members to return borrowed books, updating their borrowing status and the availability of the book.
- **Display Books**: Display all books in the library, along with their availability status.
- **Display Members**: Display all members (students and faculty) and their details.

## System Requirements
- C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC)
- C++11 or later

## Compilation and Execution

### 1. Save the Code
Save the code in a file named `library_management_system.cpp`.

### 2. Compile the Program
To compile the program, open your terminal/command prompt and run the following command:

For **Linux/macOS**:
```bash
g++ library_management_system.cpp -o library_management_system
```

For **Windows** (using MinGW or similar):
```bash
g++ library_management_system.cpp -o library_management_system.exe
```

### 3. Run the Program
Once the program is compiled, run it as follows:

For **Linux/macOS**:
```bash
./library_management_system
```

For **Windows**:
```bash
library_management_system.exe
```

### 4. Menu Options
After running the program, youâ€™ll be presented with the following menu:

1. **Display all Books**: View the details of all books, including their availability.
2. **Display all Members**: View the details of all members (students and faculty).
3. **Borrow Book**: Borrow a book by entering the book ID and the member ID. Students can borrow up to 5 books, while faculty can borrow unlimited books.
4. **Return Book**: Return a borrowed book by specifying the book ID and member ID.
5. **Add Book**: Add a new book to the library with a title, author, and number of copies.
6. **Add Member**: Add a new member to the library (either a student or faculty).
7. **Exit**: Exit the program.

## File Format

Currently, this system does not persist data to a file. All book and member information is stored temporarily during the program's execution.
