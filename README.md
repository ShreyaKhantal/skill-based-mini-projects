# mini-skill-projects

## Overview

The **mini-skill-projects** repository is a collection of small, manageable programming projects that aim to help developers hone their skills in various aspects of computer science. These projects cover a wide range of topics including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA). Each project is designed to provide hands-on experience with essential programming concepts and help developers solve real-world problems using different approaches.

## Purpose

This repository serves the following purposes:

- **Skill-building**: Provides mini-projects focused on key programming concepts like OOP, data structures, and algorithms.
- **Hands-on experience**: Each project is an opportunity to practice real-world programming tasks such as implementing algorithms, building systems, and designing software architectures.
- **Portfolio enhancement**: These projects are designed to be simple yet effective for showcasing your skills to potential employers or collaborators.

## Project Categories

### 1. **OOP Projects**
The OOP projects focus on demonstrating object-oriented design patterns, classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. Examples include:

- **Simple Bank**: A project to simulate banking operations like account management, deposit, and withdrawal using OOP concepts.
- **Library Management**: A system for managing books, members, and transactions in a library setting.
- **Student-Course Management**: A system to manage student enrollment in courses, including course registration and grade management.

### 2. **DSA Projects**
These projects focus on implementing fundamental data structures and algorithms. Examples include:

- **Prefix-Postfix**: A project that evaluates expressions given in prefix or postfix notation using appropriate data structures.
- **City Connections BFS**: A graph-based project using Breadth-First Search (BFS) to model city connections and find paths.
- **Phone Directory**: A directory management system that organizes phone numbers and performs efficient search and retrieval operations.

## Getting Started

To start with these projects:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mini-skill-projects.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd mini-skill-projects
   ```

3. **Choose a project**:
   Each project has its own folder under **OOP-Projects** or **DSA-Projects**. Navigate to the folder of the project you want to explore.

4. **Follow the instructions**:
   Each project has a `README.md` file with specific instructions on how to run the project. These instructions will include any dependencies or requirements for the project.

5. **Run the project**:
   Execute the project as specified in its README file (usually by compiling the `main.cpp` file).
